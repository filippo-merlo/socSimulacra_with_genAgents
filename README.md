# Social Simulacra with Generative Agents

This repository explores a compelling convergence of two ground-breaking methods in social computing:

- [**Generative Agents**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) simulate lifelike behaviors—including habit formation, planning, memory, and reflection—by extending large language models with natural-language memory and context retrieval, enabling agents to observe, reflect on past experiences, and plan actions in a believable way.

- [**Social Simulacra**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04024) are prototyping systems that autonomously generate rich, realistic social interactions based on a designer’s specification of community *goals*, *rules*, and *member personas*. They produce dynamic simulations of posts, replies, and even anti-social behaviors to help designers anticipate emergent social dynamics before deployment.

##  What This Project Offers

By infusing Social Simulacra with the cognitive depth of Generative Agents, this project enhances both the **realism** and **diagnostic power** of simulated communities:

- Each synthetic user acts like a full-fledged conversational entity with memory, personality, and reflective reasoning.
- Agents evolve over time and interact meaningfully with context and other agents.
- Designers can probe the simulation at the level of individual agents—for example, asking *“Why did you respond that way?”*—to gain deeper insights into social dynamics and design robustness.
