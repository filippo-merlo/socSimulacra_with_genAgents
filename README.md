# Social Simulacra with Gnerative Agents
The idea proposed by this project is to use the ”generative agents” described in the study ”Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra
of Human Behavior” (Park 2023) to enhance the believability of the social interaction simulation used in the prototyping technique of ”social simulacra” described in ”Social
Simulacra: Creating Populated Prototypes for Social Computing Systems” (Park 2022). The utility of this choice extends beyond the credibility of the simulation because equipping each agent with its own personality, memory, and reflective abilities makes it possible to gather insights on the interaction directly from individual agents.
